# Unity-First-Game

This is my first project in unity. This game is about a cube that need to pass throught all the obstacle to win. When doing this game, I learned how to make the player movement
in some ways and also the collision detection between the player with other obstacles. The camera will follow the player and the score will also be updated based on the current
player position. I also added some features before we enter the game and quit the game after we finish the game. This is just a simple project that maded by unity and also my 
first project in unity.
